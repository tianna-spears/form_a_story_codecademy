Form A Story Project for HTML Forms and Building Interactive Websites- Codecademy

This project contains the project, Form A Story, from the Front-End Developer Career Path on Codecademy. 

I coded the HTML file, index.html, by myself. 

For this project, I wanted to specifically focus on the below HTML Forms, inputs, elements, and attributes.

- <input> type- text, number, checkbox, range, radio
- <element>- textarea, form, input, select, datalist, label
- Attributes- min, minlength, max, maxlength, name, required

For full clarity, the CSS file was provided by Codecademy. I look forward to building my CSS skills in the near future, but first wanted to focus specifically on HTML Forms.

Thank you for reading and following my progress!
